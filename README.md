### Hi! My name is Park Ha Eun. 
I'm a student at Gachon University and majoring in software.
I have a dream of becoming an information security expert(White Hacker).
So I'm currently studying various things. GitHub is one of them. 
From now on, I'll share the code that I studied and made here.
There's still a lot to study, but look at my growth. Thank you.
